# 🥁 AirDrum (ECE362 Project)

AirDrum is a gesture-controlled embedded percussion system that allows users to play drums in the air.  
An IMU-enabled stick detects motion in real time and triggers corresponding drum sounds through a speaker, while a VGA display provides live visual feedback.

## 📌 Project Overview

AirDrum integrates multiple hardware peripherals on the RP2350 platform:

- **I²C** for IMU communication  
- **PWM** for audio waveform generation  
- **VGA** for graphical drum kit display  
- **ADC** for analog volume control  

The system converts motion data into synchronized audio and visual output in real time.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user swings the stick.
2. The IMU (LSM6DSOX) sends accelerometer and gyroscope data to the RP2350 via I²C.
3. The firmware analyzes motion strength and direction to determine which drum is hit.
4. The RP2350 generates the corresponding drum sound using timer-driven PWM.
5. The VGA display highlights the triggered drum icon.
6. A potentiometer connected to the ADC adjusts the output volume smoothly.
